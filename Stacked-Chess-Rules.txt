STACKED CHESS RULES:

1. Ability to stack pieces on top of eachother
	1a. In order to stack, piece must move onto the square of another piece.
		ex: Ra1->a2
	1b. The stack works like a soldier on a horse. The "stacked" top piece is the soldier and the bottom piece is the horse
	1c. The "horse" of the stack determines the movement of the piece, and the "soldier" is able to attack normally used dismount method

2. Dismount Method
	2a. A piece is able to dismount its stack in the way that that piece moves. This can be a dismount to a untaken square or to attack
	2b. If attacking a unstacked square, the dismounted piece takes the square
	2c. If attacked a stacked square, the dismounted piece takes the "soldier"/top piece of the stack and moves back 1 space in the direction it came from following the pieces movement pattern.
	2ci. If the attacking piece is a knight, there is no dismount and the knight takes the opponents piece and returns back to its stack
	2d. A dismounted piece cannot dismount and create another stack. It must either take a opponents piece or move to a untaken square.

Misc.

If a king is stacked onto another piece and that square is put into check, the king is also put into check and must either dismount or move out of check.
